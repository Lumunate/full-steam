Danielle is doing very well in science. Excellent feedback from her teachers. Give Asma all the credit for her hard work and patience.

I’m so grateful for all the hard work and effort Asma put into each of our lessons. Thank you so much Asma!",

Asma's impressive academic background coupled with unique experience with applied maths caught our attention immediately. After the first lesson it became quite clear that her credentials just a part of what she has to offer. Asma has an incredible gift for explaining complex topics in a very digestible and entertaining way. She has expert knowledge of a plethora of maths topics and is always prepared to present the most fun and challenging ways to tackle those. After a short while my son begged us to set up a twice- instead of once-per week tutoring sessions because he just couldn't have enough of her teaching. Asma is an amazing professional, with great attitude, experience and talent for sparking interest and motivation in her students. We couldn't ask for a better tutor for our son.",

Her teachers feedback was that this was the greatest in-year increase in maths grades for any student across the entire school. This is due to Asma's excellent teaching, also her consistent encouragement and support for my child - who came to believe she could do it. Asma is kind, reliable, and extremely good at both maths and teaching. My daughter is delighted with the results she has a achieved and as parent I can't thank Asma enough for all her help.",

Our daughter struggled with Chemistry and Physics and was not that motivated to study these subjects. Asma taught the subjects in such a way that our daughter found them interesting and after every lesson said, ‘Asma is amazing, she knows so much stuff’. She really enjoyed the lessons. Asma is able to teach in a way that suits the student and can work at their pace. She has a friendly and calm demeanour which my daughter really liked. We will be using Asma again in the future for our other daughter for sure. Thank you Asma for giving your time and creating a learning environment which resulted in a real confidence in the subjects.",

We had a very agile set up which adjusted to his needs as his knowledge progressed, meaning that the time was spent on whatever subject was most needed at the time which was great for us. Asma's knowledge and approach was invaluable. Sam excelled in his GCSEs as a result, outstripping his pre-tutoring predictions by at least two grades in each subject and a 9 in maths. Crucially, he was accepted at his chosen 6th form college and has decided to study an additional subject - further maths - which is testament to Asma's tutoring. He is a far more confident mathematician and scientist thanks to Asma and we can't recommend her highly enough.",

Maths has always been my son’s weakest subject and it has long been a struggle for him. Within 8 months of tutoring under Asma, the GCSE Maths result he achieved was an incredible improvement from grade 2 to a Grade 6 and all within a relatively short space of time. Asma is such a lovely person and takes the time to understand her student and what works best for them as no two students are the same. Without Asma’s unwavering support, achieving a GCSE grade that is 4 grades higher than prior to starting with Asma in Year 11 would have been only a dream. Thank you very much Asma - you’re a star!",
